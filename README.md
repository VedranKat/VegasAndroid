# VegasAndroid

The VegasAndroid App is an Android application built using Kotlin. It allows users to place bets on various sports events and games. The app interacts with my VegasBackend server application to provide real-time data and facilitate the betting process.

There will be 2 different versions of the app, one with a News Api as front page, and another one without it.
There will also be 2 versions of UI, XML and Jetpack Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- VegasBackend running with postgres
